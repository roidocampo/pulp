# pulp

File viewer for MacOS (for pdf, ps, and djvu files).

This branch is experimental. For a more stable version, check out the "master"
branch. If you decide to use this branch, you will need to compile Pulp by hand:

```bash
$ git clone -b nobrew https://github.com/roidocampo/pulp.git
$ cd pulp
$ make mac_app
```
